We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary which was listed on the reservation confirmation. They did not acknowledge it. The heater in our room was extremely noisy - it sounded like a bus was outside out window each time it turned on and off. I know this sounds picky but the bathroom had no hooks, even on the door so there was no place to hang anything - I had to lay my clothes on the toilet tank when I took a shower. The bathroom also didn't have a separate heater and considering it was all marble, it was very cold.

Quality of service was lacking which is unacceptable for a hotel of this caliber.    \n\nDon't get me wrong, it is still a really nice resort.

They also had their own swimming pool and personal attendant who cooked breakfast each morning. Make sure you enjoy the breakfast on the deck and have the attendant bring up cocktails in the evening to enjoy on your deck before dinner. There is one small restaurant which is intimate and very enjoyable. They offer a discovery multi course menu which is fine but feel free to ask for other things if desired. The beach is small and options for water sports are limited so be aware. Also, it appears they are going to be undergoing construction across the resort for the next year or two.

The hotel will one day be 5 star but didn’t quite make the mark yet. It was nice, 4.5 stars but little details weren’t met. Had mediocre service at one of our three on property meal visits. The other two were great. Sent a review with constructive criticism and nobody from the property reached out for more information. Bright spots were the booking, maids, and check in. Dinner service was great, breakfast not so much. While checking out I overheard another guest with the same complaint. Gravel walkways are cute but not practical for women in heels (wine country). The original Tavern was a nice touch but service was not to Auberge standards. We will try again in a few months when hopefully the kinks are worked out.'}]}"

The food is great. The rooms are immaculate. The staff is young and very capable. They can schedule just about any wine country event you would like. In our case we needed to unwind and rest after an Antarctica cruise. This was a perfect place for that. Sample some wine while you are here.

Money was not of concern, as I was celebrating my 70th and my husband his 66th, and how could we not splurge?  The Vines is an incredible property. Nestled in the Ucco Valley, at the foothills of the Andes, the views were overwhelmingly gorgeous, the deluxe villa very modern and well appointed. Accommodating and attractive staff made fires made in the fireplace and fire pit, friendly room service, turn downs, trolley service to and from the main house. Our massages were heavenly. The food at their restaurant was unique and always well prepared, from breakfast to snacks to dinner. A lively bar, a serene pool area, an extensive wine list, and always eager to please staff. Looking for someplace truly special, you've found it at The Vines. Carlos made a wise decision to recommend this property.""}, {'recommended': True, 'review_date': '12 Dec 2017', 'headline': 'Far out.', 'reviewer_name': 'By: neverstayshome', 'review_content': 'The property is gorgeous and staff were very attentive but the location is quite a distance from anything else thus you must book a car to go anywhere and the travel time can be at least an hour and usually more.

But functionally not well designed.  Shower is bad, closets and drawers poorly designed....but looks beautiful.  \n\nOverall service was poor....not because of effort but due to poor communication (due to limited or no English) and inexperience of the staff.  Most staff members have been there less than an year.  Food orders and service was challenging.  Daily activities were miscommunicated and missed as a result.  \n\nWith a more well trained staff, could be a first rate destination!'}]}"

The property was immaculate and laid out very nicely. There was plenty of space all over the property. The beach was fantastic and they even provided our kids with beach toys to play with. The pools were wonderful and the service by the pool was some of the fastest we have ever experienced. The food was great on property and one of the highlights was the little market in the lobby, it was great for quick snacks for everyone. The hotel was decorated beautifully for Christmas and the Thanksgiving buffet was incredible. The rooms were some of the nicest we have stayed in compared to other similar resorts in that area.
